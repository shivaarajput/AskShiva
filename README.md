## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v20.x or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or your preferred package manager)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shivaarajput/askshiva.git
cd askshiva
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following variable. This is required to fetch data from the community API.

```env
# The base URL for the Brainly-style API
BRAINLY_API_BASE_URL=https://knowledge-base-alpha.vercel.app
```

You will also need a Google AI API key for Genkit. Set it up in your environment or add it to the `.env` file:
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-google-ai-api-key
```

### 4. Run the Development Server

You need to run two separate processes for the Next.js frontend and the Genkit AI flows.

- **Terminal 1: Run the Next.js App**
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
  Your application will be available at [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002).

- **Terminal 2: Run the Genkit AI Flows**
  ```bash
  npm run genkit:watch
  ```
  This will start the local Genkit development server, which the Next.js app will call for AI functionality.

## üìú Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Starts the Next.js development server with Turbopack.
- `npm run build`: Builds the application for production.
- `npm run start`: Starts a production server.
- `npm run lint`: Lints the project files using Next.js's built-in ESLint configuration.
- `npm run typecheck`: Runs the TypeScript compiler to check for type errors.
- `npm run genkit:dev`: Starts the Genkit development server.
- `npm run genkit:watch`: Starts the Genkit development server in watch mode.
